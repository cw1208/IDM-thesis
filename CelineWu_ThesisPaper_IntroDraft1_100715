Pluff Thesis: Introduction, Draft 1
What was your favorite plush toy, blanket, or hat as a child?  Perhaps you had Ellie the Elephant who was always up for an adventure, or that blue blankie that came with you to school all through kindergarten. These are known as security objects, and they create an emotional safety net that can comfort the owner at any time or even help the owner feel the self-confidence to complete tasks that would normally be much more difficult. Pluff is a plush game controller and plush-inspired video game that brings a physical dimension to casual games for gamers and plush-enthusiasts to explore the nature of bonding and comfort.
